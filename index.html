    <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Hi and welcome to this website! :D This website is for facts that our
    group didn't include in our presentation at the Handley Ib Pyp
    Exhibition! Oh sorry, we forgot to tell you what our topic is...
    Our topic is Earth Problems! Also, maybe PG please üòÖ

    <h2>Man Made Earth Problems</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This section lists facts about Air pollution and Water pollution!
        <br><br>
        Air Pollution & Water Pollution<br>
        Air pollution is caused by aerosols, greenhouse gasses ( co2, etc ), car exhaust, etc.
700 million people die every year from air pollution.
More than 4000 people died in a few months in London in 1952 due to smog.
Short term exposure to air pollution can cause coughing, difficulty breathing, irritation, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, etc.
Long term exposure to air pollution can cause respiratory diseases, heart damage, liver and blood damage, nervous system damage, birth defects, and death :(.
California is banning gas powered cars to lower amounts of air pollution.
9 out 10 people breathe polluted air.
Air pollution can cause acid rain.
Air pollution causes global warming.
Breathing air pollution can take away 1-2 years of a life.
When fossil fuels are burned, they release gasses in the air creating smog and acid rain.
Air pollution from fossil fuels causes every 1 in 5 deaths.
99% of the world breathes air pollution.
Air pollution causes ground-level ozone which is a key component in smog.
Increased hospital visits for asthma and premature death.
      SOLUTIONS : conserve energy
carpool/ use public transportation
Compost items
Clean Air Act
Plant trees
Don‚Äôt use fossil fuels
Use solar energy
Use wind energy
Use geothermal energy
Use renewable energy
Clean energy production

About 593,043,485 lbs of trash are dumped into the ocean
50-75 trillion pieces of plastics are in the oceans right now
1 million seabirds die from plastic pollution each year
Some people believe that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish
8.3 billion plastic straws are along all beaches all over the earth
Water pollution causes  diseases that spread through water
Water spread diseases can occur   if water is not is not properly treated
7.2 million americans get water borne diseases 
Water pollution affects the economy
Toxins in poorly treated water can lead to immediate death , chronic toxicity , neurological problems or cancer

    <h2>Natural Earth Problems</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This section lists facts about volcanos and earthquakes!
        <br><br>
        Earthquakes & Volcanos<br>
        An Earthquake is the earth  shaking caused by a sudden slip up on a fault.           
        Stresses  in the ground‚Äôs  outer layer push the sides of the fault together.            
        Stress  in the ground builds up and the stones slip suddenly, letting the ground release energy in waves that travel through the earth‚Äôs crust and cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake.            
        Faults are produced  by tectonic plates grinding and scraping against one another as they continuously and slowly move.
        In California for a example, there are two plates-the Pacific plate (which goes from western California to Japan, as well as much of the Pacific Ocean floor and the North American plate (which is a lot of the North American continent and parts of the Atlantic Ocean.)The Pacific plate moves Northwestward past the North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault at a rate of about two inches per year.
        Pieces  of the San Andreas Fault System adapt to this movement by constant ‚Äúcreep‚Äù developing in many tiny shocks and a few average earth tremors.
        In other parts, tension can build up for hundreds of years, constructing great earthquakes when it eventually releases .
        Large and small earthquakes can also happen on faults not previously acknowledged; new earthquakes in Alabama and Virginia are good examples.
        Earthquakes take place in the crust or upper mantle, from the earth‚Äôs surface to about 400 miles below the surface.
        But the very deepest earthquakes only happen at subduction zones where cold crustal rock is being shoved  deep into the earth.
        In California, earthquakes are almost all in the top 15 miles of the crust, except in Northern California across the Cascadia Subduction Zone, which expands into Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.
        Seismologists use earthquakes to study the inner of the earth and to pinpoint faults and geologic structures such as core-mantle boundary, subduction zones, and the subsurface area of the San Andreas Fault.
        Using earthquakes and waves from earthquakes, scientists can see all of earth‚Äôs insides.
        Earthquakes produced by human activity have been recorded in the United States, Japan, and Canada.
        The source was inoculation of fluids into deep wells for trash disposal and secondary  recovery of oil, and the filling of large reservoirs for water contribution .
        Most of these earthquakes were slight.
        A volcano is when there is a crack in the earth's crust .
A volcano sets up when one tectonic plate moves under another one.
When a volcano erupts it frees lava,volcanic ash,and gasses.
